## Introduction
Path Planning in Robotics Using PSO and GWO is a collaborative project aimed at achieving efficient, accurate, and time-effective path planning for robotic systems. This project utilizes Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithms. The results obtained from PSO serve as inputs for GWO, enhancing the overall efficiency and accuracy of the path planning process. The system is designed to handle obstacles and most corner cases effectively.

## Features
- Significantly reduces path planning time compared to using PSO or GWO alone.
- Capable of navigating in the presence of obstacles.
- Provides accurate and efficient paths.
- Robust performance in most corner cases.

## Installation and Setup
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/path-planning-robotics.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd path-planning-robotics
   ```
4. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage
1. First, run the obstacle.py file:
   ```sh
   python obstacles.py
   ```
2. Run the combined.py file:
   ```sh
    python combined.py
   ```
